# Insect_classfier

Data Science project for the class of Deep Learning at CentraleSupelec using computer vision and deep learning techniques to classify insects - namingly flies, mosquitoes, butterflies and bees.

##Image Classification

Two approaches were explored to classify insect pictures. On one hand a CNN was trained from scratch using the Keras modules and Google Colab computing resources. On the other hand a Fine Tuning approached was implemented using the pre-trained Resnet network and Pytorch modules.
